                        INSTRUCTIONS

Make sure that you have the following in your .cshrc file:
(Replace "yourpath" with the path of your GEnsemble Installation)

set ge_path = /project/Biogroup/Software/GEnsemble
alias ge_blast           "$ge_path/programs/Blast.pl"
alias ge_predictm        "$ge_path/programs/PredicTM.pl"
alias ge_opthelix        "$ge_path/programs/OptHelix.pl"
alias ge_template        "$ge_path/programs/Align2Template.pl"
alias ge_bihelix         "$ge_path/programs/bihelixrot2/all_bihelix_pairs.pl"

##### Step 1: Blast and PredicTM #####
######################################

Blast can be run in one of two ways.  Blast by itself can be run using
Blast.pl, or it can be run as a precursor to PredicTM using PredicTM.pl.
To see how to run Blast through PredicTM,read the PredicTM section below.

Blast.pl Usage ::
Blast.pl -a {accession number}
Blast.pl --fasta {single-sequence FASTA file}
Blast.pl -r {raw amino acid sequence}
Blast.pl -h

The main output file will be {filename}.fta.  There are numerous options for
the program, so look at the help information to see what is available.

PredicTM, the program for predicting transmembrane regions, can be run using
PredicTM.pl.  It is possible to run Blast through PredicTM.pl, or the output
file ({filename}.fta) or a PIR alignment file can be used.

PredicTM.pl Usage ::
PredicTM.pl -f {multiple-sequence FASTA file}
PredicTM.pl -p {PIR alignment file}
PredicTM.pl -a {accession number} (for running BLAST)
PredicTM.pl --fasta {single-sequence FASTA file} (for running BLAST)
PredicTM.pl -r {raw amino acid sequence} (for running BLAST)
PredicTM.pl -h

The main output file will be {filename}.mfta.  There are numerous options for
the program, so look at the help information to see what is available.

############################
##### Step 2: OptHelix #####
############################

OptHelix optimizes the proline kinks of the helices predicted by PredicTM using
molecular dynamics.  The main input file for OptHelix is the Modified FASTA
(MFTA) file produced by PredicTM.

OptHelix.pl Usage ::
OptHelix.pl -f {modified FASTA file} --cap {pred/man} --raw {pred/man/none}

The MFTA produced by PredicTM contains placeholders for manual start/stop
residues for both the raw and capped helices.  See the OptHelix help for more
information on the MFTA format.

OptHelix will perform its dynamics on either the predicted or manual capped
helices, as specified by the user with the "--cap pred" or "--cap man" option.

The raw helices produced by OptHelix are taken from the capped helix results
as specified with the "--raw pred", "--raw man", or "--raw none" options.

Currently there is an issue where terminal hydrogens may be missing from
the ends of the helices.  Currently the only way to ensure that this does not
happen is by specifying the "--noalaninecap --raw none" option.  A fix for
this issue is expected soon.


##################################
##### Step 3: ALign2Template #####
##################################
In this step, the optimized helices from previous step are put
together into a bundle based on an input template (currently
bovine rhodopsin and human beta2 available). 

Usage:
Align2Template.pl -t {humbeta2_2rh1 or bovrhod_1gzm} -d {opthelix directory} -m {modified fasta file} -oc {minrmsd.cap or minrmsd.raw or minrmsd.cap.min or minrmsd.raw.min or mineng.cap or mineng.raw or mineng.cap.min or mineng.raw.min} -c {area or peak or rawmid or capmid or manual1 or manual2 hydrophobic centers} -p {protein tag optional}


###########################
##### Step 4: BiHelix #####
###########################
In this step, the protein bundle from previous step is used
in a BiHelix rotational procedure which samples all rotational
combinations for every pair of interacting helices and the resulting
BiHelix results are put together in a mean-field energy summation
scheme to list the top few combinations for use in the next step.
For a rotation angle grid of 30 degrees (12 choices for each helix
to cover full 360 degrees), the mean-field energy summation samples all 
12^7 = ~ 35 million structures.

Usage:
all_bihelix_pairs.pl -p {protein_bgf_file} -pairs {helixpairfile} -a {combinatorial_rotation_angle_data_file} -an {number of output combinations} -r -s -mach {machine}


##############################
##### Step 5: CombiHelix #####
##############################
This wrapper script sets up the combinatorial helix rotational
MembSCREAM step, where each helix is rotated simultaneously
by angles corresponding to those identified by bihelix.
This is followed by a full side-chain
optimization using SCREAM and an implicit membrane solvation
calculation using MembSOLV.

Usage:
combi_frombihelixsum.pl -p {protein_bgf_file} -e {Energy Criteria} -n {number of combinations for combi_scream} -r -s -m -mach {machine}


###########################
##### Important Notes #####
###########################

1) It is important to look at your alignment when running PredicTM to make sure
that the alignment makes snese.

2) It is also important to look at your raw TM predictions versus your capped
TM predictions. The capping rules make sense in most cases, but not all!  It is
often important to compare the predictions in one protein to the others in its
family or subfamily (for example compare D1 to D2, D3, D4, and D5).

3) Look to see if any helices were eliminated for being too short.  If such a
helix is very close to the end of another helix, then perhaps it should really
be a continuation and was cut off from the main helix due to a set of highly
conserved polar residues.

4) The eta angle residue calculation should be taken with a very large grain of
salt, especially if your protein is missing some of the main conserved
residues, such as the Asp in the middle of TM3.  In cases like that, it's
important to verify the automated predictions by hand.

5) It is important to view the dynamics from OptHelix.  This is facilitated by
the VMD source files in the vmd subdirectory of the OptHelix output.  Viewing
of the dynamics will identify whether any irregularities occurred during the
dyanmics, such as long-term excessive kinking or unraveling of the helices.

####################
##### Defaults #####
####################

The default parameters for Blast, PredicTM, and OptHelix are suited for both
GPCRs and other helical membrane proteins, so significant alterations should not
be needed.  However, in addition to the command line options, permanent changes
to the default can be made on both a group and an individual user basis.  In the
same directory as the Blast.pl, PredicTM.pl, and OptHelix.pl  files, there is a
.gensemble directory containing .blast, .predictm, and .opthelix files.  Editing
these .blast, .predictm, and .opthelix files will change the defaults for every
user.  However, if the .gensemble directory is copied into the user's home
directory, then Blast.pl, PredicTM.pl, and OptHelix.pl will default to the
individual user's.blast, .predictm, and .opthelix files, allowing the user to
set up defaults that are different from all other users'.

Replacement copies of the .blast, .predictm, and .opthelix files can be found
at the end of the Blast.pl, PredicTM.pl, and OptHelix.pl programs.
