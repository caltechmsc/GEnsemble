#
# cshell to submit several POLARIS calculations serially 
# it uses the user input ($1) macro name as a template
# to run over various *.bgf files.  Remember to substitute
# the name of the bgf file you use to create your macro for
# the generic name:
#                   filename
#
# Thus, for example if you made a run with histidine.bgf the
# input line in you macro will read:
#
# Top menu/in-out
#        In-Out/read
#        File types/BioDesign
#          "histidine.bgf"
#
# change the name "histidine" to "filename" so this cshell can find it
# here. Do the same anywhere through your entire macro.  Note that
# you can use this cshell with any other macro you generate in POLARIS.
#
# To submit this cshell just type:
#    
#      % csh run_macro your_macro.macro &
#
# on the Unix command line. All results will go to *.log files 
# The cshell assumes you use the command "polaris" to run POLARIS.
# As an example of your_macro.macro see
#
#                  logp_all.macro
#
# Begin Cshell:
#
alias rm rm
foreach file (*.bgf)
echo Working on $file ...
sed "s/filename/$file:r/" $1 > $file:r.macro
polaris  $file:r.macro >> $file:r.log
rm $file:r.macro
echo $file job completed.
end
#
# End Cshell.
