SuperBiHelix programs
---------------------

run_super_bihelix.pl submits the 12 pbs jobs for running super_bihelix and the analysis.

super_bihelix_pl.pl controls the superbihelix and analysis jobs.

super_bihelix.cpp does the super_bihelix sampling for a pair of helices.

fix_angles_file.cpp takes the angles.txt and puts in any angles not explicitly in the file.  

super_anal1.cpp runs the quadhelix analysis on the 1-2-3-7 bundle.

super_anal2.cpp runs the quadhelix analysis on the 2-3-4-5 bundle.

super_anal3.cpp runs the quadhelix analysis on the 3-5-6-7 bundle.

super_anal_sort2.cpp used the quadhelix analysis to determine which angles to use for the super_bihelix analysis.

output_TM_configs.cpp uses the Consensus_*.out files to output files in a readable format that show the ranking of conformations for each helix.

mean_field_anal.cpp calculates the total bihelical energy for bundles.

mean_field_order.cpp puts the bundles in order by total bihelical energy.    

In the super_bihelix_anal directory is run_super_bihelix_anal.pl, which submits the pbs jobs for running the super_bihelix analysis, without running super_bihelix.cpp.

super_bihelix_anal.pl controls the analysis jobs.


SuperComBiHelix programs
------------------------

run_super_combihelix.pl submits the pbs jobs to do super_combihelix, which builds the entire bundles from the best super_bihelix structures.

super_combihelix.pl runs super_combihelix.

make-bgf-for-combi.pl makes a bgf bundle file for super_combihelix.

rmsd_hive.pl and rmsd_matrix.pl calculate the rmsd of a reference structure to a structure built for super_combihelix. 

super_combi_sort.pl puts the bundles in order by total energy.

rmsd_hive.  


Other notes
-----------

All of the c++ (.cpp files) programs were compliled with icc, on both hive and matrix.  The _matrix files can be used on borg or matrix.  Any program that calls a c++ program must also have a matrix version.
