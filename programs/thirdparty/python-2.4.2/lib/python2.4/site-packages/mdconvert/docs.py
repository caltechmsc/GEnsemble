1. Why is the number of residues and net mass different for AMBER and
   MMTK columns in MMTK Universe Creator?

   This happens for |old OPLS| forcefield since for proteins in
   aminoacid residues instead of hydrogen atoms there're tritium
   atoms. This is why Amber TIP3P water has mass of 22.032...

   The difference in the number of residues is pretty obvious,
   |mdconvert| allows for independent defintions of molecules which
   means that if a molecule in AMBER consist of 6 residues it CAN
   consist of 4 residues in MMTK provided there's a proper definition
   of the same molecule in the MMTK Database.
