!  This file contains all the variables which can currently be reset
!  by input from am ascii file (i.e. DEFAULTS file).
!  The values displayed here indicate the program DEFAULTS.
!  If you wish to override any of these DEFAULTS, you should create a
!  new file and eliminate any variables which are not changed (to speed
!  up execution time). Comments can be interspersed through this file by
!  preceding with exclamation points. This file is free format.  A line
!  ending with a minus sign (-) is continued on the next line.  Strings
!  containing blanks or ending in (-) may be surrounded with quotes (").
