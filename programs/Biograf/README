This is installation instructions for setting up
Biograf on your linux system.  This has been tested
only on RedHat 9.0, and may have issues with another
version of Linux.

These files should be installed in the ${membstruk} 
directory. 

Your .cshrc file should be modified to include:
  if ( -f ${membstruk}/Biograf/.cshrc ) source ${membstruk}/Biograf/.cshrc
after you have setup the following environmental variables:
  membstruk  - Directory with no "/" on the end
  memtmp1    - Temp directory for extira files, no "/" on
               the end.
This is all done for you, if MembStruk is already installed,
and you have the membstruk.sh sourced in your .cshrc.

You can now run this by typing:
bgver 330
${membstruk}/Biograf/bio_linux linux {FF filename}

The FF files available are (by name):
amber   - The amber forcefield: S.J.WEINER,P.A.KOLLMAN,
          ETC,JACS 106,p765 (1984)
amberb  - Augmented amber FF: S.J. Weiner, P.A. Kollman,
          et. al, J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 106,765 (1984) and
          J. Comput. Chem. 7, 230 (1986)
Biograf - FF used in MembStruk, driedii FF with quanta
          conversions.
charmm  - CHARMM FF: Brooks et. al. J. Comp. Chem. 4

Alias were created from the bgver 330 command to run the
program. They are:
bioamb  - Biograf with the amber ff
biobio  - Biograf setup for MembStruk
biodre  - Biograf with the dredi ff
biodr2  - Biograf with the updated dredii ff
biogen  - Biograf with the genff ff
biomm2  - Biograf with the mm2 ff
biomp2  - Biograf with the updated mmp2 ff
biouff  - Biograf with the uff ff

To set up symbolic links to the current ffs used in MembStruk,
run the INSTALL.sh script.  This is only needed if you have 
access to the MembStruk FF files and they are installed in:
${membstruk}/FF/
Otherwise, the installation comes with the ff files from the
MembStruk 4.10 (2-24-2005) version.
